## 3D Text (Label3D)
* Hello! This is an addon built for Godot 3.1.x that adds 3D labels to your arsenal of nodes. It's just like a regular label, but in 3D! The addon simply adds a new node called Label3D that you can add anywhere in your 3D environment.

## Audio Effect Inspector
* Audio Effects could be confusing to users who may be unfamiliar with the Audio Engineering environment and its tools. Looking at sliders with no visual feedback may seem a little daunting. This is where the Audio Effect Inspector comes in handy! It enables you to control your tools much easier with a graphical interface; like any VST plugin used in DAWs.

## GDUnzip
* Gdunzip is a zip file browser/decompressor written entirely in a single GDScript file. You can use this in games you're building with the Godot game engine. This script is meant for modest zip decompressing purposes, since the inflate algorithm it contains isn't super fast and gdunzip doesn't do CRC checks of the uncompressed files. However, gdunzip works fine if you only need to decompress small files, or when your zip files contain precompressed files like png's.

## JSON Configuration File
* JSON Configuration File is a plugin for Godot that aims to aid reading user input via a JSON file. Using a JSON file as a way to configure your Godot application would allow your users to share configuration files. Minecraft is a remarkable example that uses JSON files to configure certain aspects of the game, such as block models.

The definition of JSON Schemas inspired this plugin. However, instead of using a JSON file to define the structure of a JSON, it takes a coding approach. This approach has the advantage of allowing more features.

## Javascript / Typescript
* This module implements JavaScript/TypeScript language support for the godot game engine. QuickJS is used as the ECMAScript engine.
* Author: @GodotExplorer
* [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IFu6LU7.png" width="100"/>](https://github.com/GodotExplorer/ECMAScript)

## Kotlin
* This is a Kotlin language binding for the Godot game engine. It uses GDNative to interact with Godot's core api's. The binding provides you Godot API's as Kotlin classes, so you can write your game logic completely in Kotlin. It will be compiled into a dynamic library using Kotlin/Native. You don't have to worry about any binding logic. Just write your game scripts like you would for GDScript or C# but with all the syntactic sugar of kotlin.
