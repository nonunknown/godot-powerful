# Godot Text Editor
A little plugin to easy-way manage your text files inside your project folder. 

Author: *"Nicolo (fenix) Santilio"*  
Version: *1.7.1*  
Godot Version: *3.2.1*  

**This repository was pushed directly from Godot Engine Editor thanks to [GitHub Integration](https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.github-integration)!**  

## What is this?
This is a little plugin I've made to easily edit text files in your project folder.  

## How does it work?
You can open an existing file, create a new file and delete a file.  
When opening / creating a file, the editor will open and you will be able to edit it and save it.  
You can just *Save* the file, or *Save file As* a new file (if it is a new file but also to make some copies).  
You will also be able to see some informations about the file you are editing (time and date of last edit) and you can set your editor to *Read Only* if you don't want to make changes but still read the content of the file.  
Multiple files can be opened in different tabs.
