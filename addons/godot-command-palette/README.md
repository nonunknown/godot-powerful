Command Palette is a Godot addon inspired by CtrlP, making it faster and easier to open the resource you're looking for in the Godot editor.

To use it, just press `Control + P` to open the finder, start typing the name of your resource, and once it's selected, press enter to open it.

While using the finder, you can use the up and down arrow keys to change the selected resource, or press escape to close the finder.
